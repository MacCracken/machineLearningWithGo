# Notes

## Probability

* Likelihood of events or observations
* Examples - if we are going to flip a coin to make a decision
* Similar questions come up when doing machine learning
* Built on probabilistic rules and theorems

### Random Variable

* Value could be on the outcomes
* Allow to define how likely and how significant sort of quesitons
* Have a finite number of outcomes
* Represent ranges of continious variables

### Probability Measures

* Quantify the answer
* Represented by a number between 0 and 1
* Presentage between 0% and 100%
* Must add up to 1
* Correspond to one of the possible outcomes
* Independent - one doesn't affect probability of other events
* Dependent events probability of one infuences the another event
* Quantify this second type of probability
* Bayes theorem - P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)

## Hypothesis Testing

* Formulate null hypothesis (H0) and alternate hypothese (Ha)
* Determine test statistic
* Determine a p-value
* Compare your p-value with a predetermined threshold

### Test Statistics

* Z-statistic
* T-statistic
* F-statistic
* chi-square statistic
