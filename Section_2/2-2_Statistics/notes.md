# Why Statistics

* Gain an understanding of data
* Quantify data and results
* Provides mechanism to
  * Measure performance
  * Prevent Pitfalls

## Distribution

* Representation of values appearance within a dataset
* Example
  * Tracking the daily sales of a certain product or service
  * Have a long list of these daily sales numbers

### Central Tendency Measures

* Most of the values are located
* Center of distribution is located

### Spread or Dispersion Measures

* Way values of distribution are spread across distribution's range

### Mean

* Sum all of the numbers in distribution
* Divide it by the count of the numbers

### Median

* Spearates the lowest half of the numbers from the highest half of the numbers

### Mode

* Frequently occurring value in the distribution

### Measures of Spread or Dispersion

* Maximum
* Minimum
* Range
* Variance
* Standard deviation (sqrt of variance)
* Quantiles/quartiles

#### Variance

* Calculated by
  * Considering each value in distribution
  * Calculating difference from distribution's mean
  * Squaring difference
  * Adding it to other squared differences
  * Dividing by number of values

#### Quantiles/Quartiles

* Similar to median
* Define cut-off points in distribution
  * Lower values are below the measure
  * Higher values are above the measure

### Visualizing Distributions

* Visualize the distribution to gain the most intuition
* Create visual representation of a distribution of values
* Form a mental model of the data
* Communicate information about data

#### Histogram

* Way of organizing or counting values
* Plotted in a histogram plot
* First create a certain numnber of bins
* Count values in each of these bins
  * Easily convert this to a plot of coun ts
  * Provisdes a nice visual representation of our distribution
* Idea about grouping and spread of values
* Has several marked features

#### Boxplot
