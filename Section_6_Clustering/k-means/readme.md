# [k-mean Clustering]

* Iterative method
* Data points are clustered around cluster centroids
* Adjusted during each iteration

![cluster example]

## Requirements

* Choose how many clusters will results from clustering
* Parameter k - gives k-means its name
* Randomly choose x1 and x2 locations of k centroids
* Serve as our starting point for the algorithm
