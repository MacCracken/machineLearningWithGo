# Linear Regression

* Most simple machine learning models
* Interpretable
* Provide a safe a productive option for data scientists
* Consider and try linear regression to predict a continuous variable

## y = __mx__ + __b__

### Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

* Use to determine __m__ and __b__
* pick a value for __m__ and __b__
* Measure vertical distance
* Distances - errors or residuals

### Linear Regression Assumptions

* Similar to machine learning models
  * It does not work in all situations
  * Make certain assumptions about data and its relationships
